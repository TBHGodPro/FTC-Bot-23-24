## Controls

### Movement

- Left joystick moves forward/back and left/right.
- Right joystick turns.

No matter what direction you are facing, moving forward will move in the configured forward direction.

The forward direction is configured when the bot starts, and can be reconfigured by clicking the **start** button on the **gamepad**.

### Arm/Wrist/Hand

- The **right** trigger moves the arm **up**
- the **left** trigger moves the arm **down**

  <br/>

- The **right** button (above the right trigger) moves the wrist **up**
- the **left** button (above the left trigger) moves the wrist **down**

<br/>

- Clicking **X** will **close** the hand
- Clicking **Y** will **open** the hand

#### Special Positions

- Clicking **B** will take the arm and wrist into **intake position**, and it will open the wrist
- Clicking **A** will take the arm and wrist into **backboard position**
- Clicking the **LOGITECH** button on the **middle** of the controller will take the arm and wrist into **overhead backboard position**

#### Re-Aligning

In case the arm gets mis-aligned, you can re-align it by taking it to start position using your triggers, and then clicking the **back** button on the **gamepad**.

This will save that start position and base all other movements on it.

### Auto-Placement

The D-Pad can be used for the **Automatic Backboard Placement System (ABPS)**.

When you click the **left** or **right** D-Pad buttons, the bot will automatically turn to the corresponding direction and look for April Tags. If it finds them, it will move towards them and place the pixel on the backboard correctly.

Any movements done while the ABPS is active will immediately de-activate it.
